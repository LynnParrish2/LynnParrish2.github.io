## Homebrew

Homebrew is a very useful package manager used in either macOS or Linux. As of version 3.0.0, Homebrew mostly supports Apple Macs with the M1 processor and legacy configurations still work using Rosetta 2 for Intel x86. What’s great about Homebrew is that it is an open source package manager that was written using Ruby and features Git. Software install packages can be performed by simply using a brew install.

## Install Homebrew

Homebrew requires a minimum of a 64-bit Intel processor or Apple M1 for macOS. Additionally, macOS 10.14 and above is needed. Either the Xcode Command Line Tools or full Xcodeinstall should also be present. 

Run from the command line

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)”`

A command to show possible packages ready to install is `brew search`
