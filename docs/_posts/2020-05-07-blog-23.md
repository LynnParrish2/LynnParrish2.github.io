## macOS Share Disk

One method for transferring files between two Macs has been target disc mode. With the new M1 macs this option is no longer available. To make a physical connection between a new M1 mac and an older Intel mac for example a different procedure is required. Target Disk Mode is a simple way to connect mac machines together that is quicker than sending files wirelessly.


##  Navigate to Share Disk

The way to get to the share disk functionality will mean shutting the M1 mac down and restarting 

Starting the machine into macOS Recovery by pressing the power button on boot until the `Loading startup options` shows, then release

After a few seconds the machine's disk drive will show next to `Options`, click `Continue` to proceed to Recovery

If FileVault is enabled, the password must be entered to authenticate first 

Enter macOS Recovery and at the screen `Select an admin user you know the password for` Select user, enter password, click continue

Now in the full Recovery Menu, select `Utilities` at the top of the screen and select `Share Disc`

The current hard drive on the machine is now highlighted, if there is encryption enabled, enter password to unlock disk

Now a `Start Sharing` button for the disk or drive is displayed

Note that sharing the disk requires the connection cable between the two machines to be USB or Thunderbolt

Click `Start Sharing`

There will be a message now displayed in the window the disk is now being shared

In target Mac open Finder, on the left pane under `Locations` select the source machine itself or network and navigate to shared disc

A quick connection and loading may occur before the shared drive shows in Finder
