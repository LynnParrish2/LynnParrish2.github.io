## macOS Share Disk

One method for transferring files between two Macs has been target disc mode. With the new M1 macs this option is no longer available. To make a physical connection between a new M1 mac and an older Intel mac for example a different procedure is required. Target Disk Mode is a simple way to connect mac machines together that is quicker than sending files wirelessly.


##  Navigate to Share Disk

The way to get to the share disk functionality will mean shutting the M1 mac down and restarting 

Recovery Assistant

If FileVault is enabled, the password must be entered to authenticate first 

Enter macOS Recovery and at the screen “Select an admin user you know the password for”

Select user enter password and click the Next arrow

Now in the full Recovery Menu, select Utilities at the top of the screen and select share disc

Select the disk or hard drive from the current machine so its highlighted, this drive will display on the other connected machine 

Note that sharing the disc requires the connection cable to the other Mac to be USB or Thunderbolt

Click “Start Sharing”

There will be a message now displayed in the window the disk is now being shared

In the connected, target Mac open finder and on the left pane under “Locations” select the machine or network and navigate to the shared disc

A quick connection and loading may occur before the shared drive shows in finder
