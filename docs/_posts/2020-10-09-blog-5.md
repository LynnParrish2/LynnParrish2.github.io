## Alpine Linux


There are some definite benefits for the Alpine Linux distribution. One of the main benefits is its scale and run from ram.

Alpine was built to run efficiently being created using busybox and musl lib C. Alpine is smaller than most Linux flavors

The size lends itself to speed and efficiency versus larger linux distros such as Ubuntu. Some would say this comes at a slight cost of polish and ease of use.

This distribution is well suited for container such as Docker; containers can be around 8 MB and built quickly.

Alpine simplifies operations by using its own APK or Alpine Package Keeper. There is also use of a script driven setup.

Another focus of Alpine is security. The userland binaries are compiled as Position Independent Executables (PIE).

The structure of the distro is designed to offer more security and vulnerability from threats such as zero day attacks.

Besides containerization, there are other industries  making use of the distro including telephone and hosting companies
