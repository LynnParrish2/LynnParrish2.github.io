## Reaper

[Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/download.php) is a digital audio production software for computers that enables MIDI and multitrack audio features such as mixing, editing, processing, mastering and recording. Reaper supports an extensive range of hardware and works on operating systems such as Windows, Linux and macOS. Of course there is support for M1 processors with an ARM64 beta version. Reaper is used in many commercial and studio environments and is not a free application. The non-commercial private license however is very [reasonably](https://www.reaper.fm/purchase.php) priced.

## Installing Application and Plugins

Download the Reaper `.dmg` file, open it and drag to the applications folder. Launch the application, selecting `open` at the are you sure window prompt. At the opening, choose an audio device to use with Reaper, then click apply and ok. An evaluation status is good for 60 days before the application will require a personal or commercial key. Select `Options` at top menu above, then show Reaper resource path in finder. This path will be used to install the basic plugin options to get started with the Reaper application. Leave the window open since the `UserPlugins` folder is needed. Download the [SWS](https://sws-extension.org/) Reaper extension in the ARM64 verison available for macOS. Open the sws `.dmg` file and drag the `.dylib` into the `UserPlugins` folder. Close the Reaper application and launch it again. Upon launching Reaper again an alert for the sws plugin shows. Click ok on the window then go to `Systems Preferences` and `Security and Privacy` to allow the plugin under the `General` tab. Closing Reaper and re-opening the application will trigger one last alert for the sws plugin which can be finished by selecting `open` at the window. The second plugin needed is actually the Reaper package manager [ReaPack](https://reapack.com/). Once the ARM 64-bit version is downloaded, move the file to the `UserPlugins` folder as done in previous steps. Close and reopen the Reaper application, using the same process above to authorize ReaPack. Now when Reaper is opened a window appears showing the available repositories to manage, select ok. By selecting the `Extensions` tab at the top menu, both `SWS` and `ReaPack` options are shown at the bottom. Reaper is now ready to start new projects!
