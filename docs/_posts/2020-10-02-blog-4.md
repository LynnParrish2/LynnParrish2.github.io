## Lab 2 Dockerfile



The first step is to use vi to create the Dockerfile that will be used to make the test container

In the FROM line the Dockerfile will need a software and version such as Ubuntu 18.04 for the base image

The Dockerfile will need the ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND clause for a non-interactive install 

This is important so that the user is not prompted during installation for things such as time zones and country choice 

In the RUN line there will need to be a list of all the core applications along with dependencies required for the auto LAMP install and so the Affinity Web Service can function

The next important aspect of the Dockerfile is the git clone of the tech lab affinity.git, then to change owner and group, create symbolic link

Instead of the COPY option regarding changing the value of DocumentRoot, the command below can be used instead 

RUN sed -ri -e 's#DocumentRoot /var/www/html#DocumentRoot /var/www/html/public#' /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf 

To grab the apache2.conf from the previous Lab 1 Docker container the command below can be used to COPY  file locally for the container build

RUN curl for the Composer Install 

Use docker build -t to create the container 

Run this new container using docker run -it  /bin/bash to get an interactive terminal 

Once inside the container run service apache2 start 

To check if the Affinity Web Service is functioning properly use curl localhost
