## Making a bootable Big Sur Installer

Making a backup installer for MacOS has normally been a standard practice for the new OS versions. By placing the install files on bootable media such as a usb flash drive upgrading other machines is an easy task. One other benefit of having the install media saved is that OS upgrades can be done when servers for the installare down or running very slowly.

## Download Install Files

Head to the App Store in macOS search for Big Sur in utilities, click get to re-download the Big Sur installer. The Software Update mechanism is triggered and the install should begin to download. The install file will go to the applications folder.

## Create USB Media

With the install file downloaded the next step is to plug in a decent sized usb flash drive of 16GB or more. Terminal will be used to complete the process.
