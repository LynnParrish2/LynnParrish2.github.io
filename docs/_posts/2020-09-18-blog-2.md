                                        Kubernetes



Kubernetes is an open source system for deployment automation, scaling, and management of container applications

Kubernetes groups application containers into logical units for easier management and discovery

The open source nature of Kubernetes allows for usage in hybrid or public cloud environments

While there may be an initial high learning curve for many new users, there are some notable advantages in the Kubernetes system

Kubernetes includes built in high fault tolerance, auto scaling based traffic and server load, a CSI interface with built in logging and monitoring tools

Aside from being an orchestration program supported among all major cloud providers, Kubernetes offers many more standout features that include:




Automated rollouts and rollbacks - application or config changes are progressively rolled out while application health is monitored, a bad change will be rolled back


Service discovery and load balancing - pods are given their own IP addresses with a single DNS name for a pod set, which can be load balanced


Service Topology - routing of service traffic is based on cluster topology


Storage orchestration - Auto mount a storage system of choice from local storage, a public cloud provider or a network storage system 


Secret and configuration management - deploy and update secrets and application configuration without the need to rebuild an image or expose stack config secrets 


Automatic bin packing - arranges containers automatically based on resource requirements while still maintaining availability 


Batch execution - management is available for services, batch and CI workloads with an option to replace failed containers


Self healing - failed containers are restarted, containers are replaced and rescheduled when a node dies, containers are killed when not responding to user defined health checks


Horizontal Scaling - applications are scaled up and down by command, UI or auto set based on CPU utilization
