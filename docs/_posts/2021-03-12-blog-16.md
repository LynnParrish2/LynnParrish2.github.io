## Windows 10 ARM

Parallels Desktop 16 for Mac has already been installed on my M1 Mac to have some working form of virtual machine access to install Linux. Windows 10 is not my primary OS of choice but is handy to have on a Mac. This is needed to have an easy way to run Microsoft Access which is not available on the Office 365 Mac version of the suite. The virtual machine option for Windows on M1 machines is also the only option for now to get Windows since Bootcamp is not supported at this time. Additional steps are required to get the correct Windows ISO or .VHDX file needed to install the ARM virtual machine.


## Windows Insider Download

In order to download the ARM specific version of Windows 10 needed for Parallels Desktop, access to the Windows Insider Program is required. This software is essentially in beta form. The first step is to create a Microsoft account, I didnâ€™t have one so I made a new email. Once the Microsoft account is signed in it was simple to get the needed Windows 10 [version] (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewARM64) The file clocks in at over 9 GB and is a .VHDX type.


## Install Windows 10 ARM via Parallels Desktop 16

With the needed install file its easy to get the new virtual machine going. Press the + at the right corner of the control center to start the installation assistant.

Continue with the screen to Create New, selecting the .VHDX file from Windows Insider.

The Virtual Machine Config can be left at defaults to make the process quicker.



The install time is blisteringly fast, the OS signs in as a prerelease evaluation copy. Still, the build is mostly stable and workable for some testing usage.
