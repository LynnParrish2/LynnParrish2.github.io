                                            BCC



BCC or the BPF Compiler Collection are a set of tools utilizing the extended Berkeley Packet Filter abilities built into the Linux kernel that allow Linux Dynamic Tracing.

The BCC tools are an open source IO Visor project. BCC requires a minimum Linux kernel version 4.1, with some specific tools needing kernel versions 4.4 or 4.6.

BCC is essentially an in-kernel virtual machine that can perform efficient JIT tracing.

BCC enables observation of any software execution and the tools can do static or dynamic tracing on kernel and user level code.

Some types of tracing abilities include: kprobes, uprobes, tracepoints, perf_events, trace block I/O, trace active tcp connects, syscalls and other TCP functions.

BCC allows for program types that include Container Security, DDoS Mitigation, Intrusion Detection, and Observability Tools.

Custom tools can be written using front ends in Python or Lua to avoid using assembly code.

There are many prebuilt Observability Tools within the BCC Toolkit associated with performance analysis. Some notable and new tools are listed below.
