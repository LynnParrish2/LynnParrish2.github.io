## ERP Software

ERP or Enterprise research planning software is a software management system that enables organizations merge business processes using applications to manage and streamline many routine but essential operations. ERP software is designed to be flexible and versatile. The nature of an ERP system is that it can be adapted to meet many organizational needs. This means that there are many aspects in the systems functions that can be tweaked and customized.

Some examples to detail potential software parameter customizations are:

`A zip code table that validates addresses by comparing them to a USPS zip code database`

`A mechanism to select from different payment processes such as credit cards to work in a company environment`

`A workflow mechanism that chooses what functions happen and in which order based on a selected criteria`  

These examples feature parameters, such as zip codes which control processing and are based on initial user systems choices. The choices and parameters chosen will greatly control the behavior that spans the entire ERP system. One well known option that scales up to large businesses is the web based ERP system Oracle's NetSuite.
