## Terraform


Terraform is described as a provisioning tool for creating, modifying and versioning infrastructure

Terraform can be used with providers such as AWS, Azure, Oracle, Google Cloud and many more

Terraform utilizes configuration files to determine what components to create  and the items size, from single applications up to the size of a datacenter

Terraform assembles an execution plan to build a desired infrastructure, then executes on that plan

The tool can also monitor changes in infrastructure environments and create incremental plans to use

Examples of infrastructure that can be managed include networking, storage, SaaS and DNS

The term most associated with HashiCorp Terraform is Infrastructure as Code 

Execution plans in Terraform are the actual planning phase to show what will happen when applied

A great benefit of Terraform is that it builds efficient infrastructure and graphs resources for insight 

Errors can be minimized for changesets applied to infrastructure. When combined with the execution plan and resource graph, human interaction is reduced. Terraform will show the order of changes.

Another key usage for Terraform is the ability to create disposable work environments which can be used to simulate a real production environment to test out things and later can be trashed.

Using a multi-cloud environment can be beneficial for uptime and fault tolerance reasons alone

Terraform is not cloud provider specific and can be configured to handle cross cloud scenarios
