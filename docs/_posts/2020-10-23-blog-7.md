## Ansible Playbook

## Stage 1

This phase of the Ansible Playbook Lab 3 will be used to start a new container 

I used the command docker run --name lab3 -it -p 8080:80 ubuntu:18.04 /bin/bash

Next step is apt update && apt install ansible -y

Ansible is installed, now cd to home and create ansible directory, install vim

Enter vim to start formatting Playbook watching line spacing 

Input hosts, local connection, first task install initial packages

First packages installed to test are zip, apache2, curl, git

## Stage 2

In this phase I will run the playbook ansible-playbook apache.yml

First Playbook run is sucessful, test initial package installs to confirm

## Stage 3

This stage will be used to install the remainder of the initial required packages 

Before getting into Stage 4, will enter /var/www/html to delete index.html

This is to prevent a Playbook failure when cloning over the techlab repo

Changing ownership in /var/www/html/affinty is the next playbook step

Creating a symbolic link is next for /affinity/public and /html/public

Running playbook to test last changes results in error, missing link state

Adding state:link tests successful in playbook now on to the next phase

## Stage 4

In this stage the copy module will be used to move over the two .conf files

Two copy entries are needed for 000-default.conf and apache2.conf

Attention is needed for src: and dest: lines, should be separated 

Running playbook for the two copy entries successful 

Composer Install will require shell: with curl to implement composer

While running playbook, alert text about curl usage, info given to suppress

Added args: warn: no for composer install, testing in playbook yields no alert

Starting composer inside /var/www/html/affinity required several line changes

The composer: line required a new line, command:install

The second composer line under command is, working_directory: /var/www/html/aff

Running test on playbook fails, wrong syntax on starting affinity

Correct format is working_dir with above path 

Running playbook now successfully installs composer

Run apache2 to test affinity splash page, curl localhost is sucessful

Run localhost:8080 in four browsers to test for splash page, successful
