## Ansible

Stage 1 of the Ansible Playbook Lab 3 will be to start a new container 

I used the command docker run --name lab3 -it -p 8080:80 ubuntu:18.04 /bin/bash

Next step is apt update && apt install ansible -y

Ansible is installed, now cd to home and create ansible directory, install vim

Enter vim to start formatting Playbook watching line spacing 

Input hosts, local connection, first task install initial packages

First packages installed to test are zip, apache2, curl, git

Stage 2 will now run the playbook ansible-playbook apache.yml

First Playbook run is sucessful, test initial package installs to confirm

Stage 3 will be to install the remainder of the initial required packages 

Before getting into Stage 4, will enter /var/www/html to delete index.html

This is to prevent a Playbook failure when cloning over the techlab repo
