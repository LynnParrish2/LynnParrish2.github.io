## Cakebrew

[Cakebrew](https://www.cakebrew.com/) is a free, open source macOS application for those people who prefer to have a GUI interface over terminal for the Homebrew package manager. You can perform some major aspects of Homebrew such as updating Homebrew, searching for formulae, install/upgrade/remove formulae, tap and untap repos, using brew cleanup, and using Doctor. To install Cakebrew, simply use the GitHub source for a universal [download](https://github.com/brunophilipe/Cakebrew) for both Intel and Apple Silicon or it can be installed via Homebrew in terminal `brew install cakebrew --cask`.
