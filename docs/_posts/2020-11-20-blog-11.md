## macOS 11 Big Sur

I had been patiently waiting to upgrade to the new MacOS operating system since it was announced in June 2020. I also did not immediately download and participate with developer/public betas, instead waiting for a release candidate or final version. On November 12th 2020 10 am PST, macOS 11 was technically available for download but this was just the of several launch issues. The OS update could not be manually found initially in the App Store. Performing a Google search I was able to find a direct web link to download in the App Store.


## Launch Day Glitches

Once the download commenced it took a very long time to make any progress on the download, surely due to the massive server demand. Once the download got to three quarters complete the first errors began to surface. Then, with any more than half progress into the download, the process would abruptly fail. This behaviour continued over and over again no matter how many download attempts. Trying again in the late afternoon still yielded no success with the install errors still occurring.

## Beta Install

In my impatience the next thought was just to bypass the official final OS version and opt for the gold master or the final release candidate and just upgrade from that version at a later time. In hindsight this was probably not the best or safest idea. After backing up my entire machine I did a google search for the Big Sur beta profile. From prior experience the gold master or beta release candidate is usually the same software version as the final official release or very close to it. Once the beta profile was configured, I rebooted the Mac to initiate the install. After around 30 minutes the install completed. I immediately checked the software version at login and in the About This Mac displays the version macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 (20B28).

## Slowness to Upgrade

Now that I have a seemingly stable version of the new OS, I can go to settings and Software Update to remove my Mac from the beta program. I can either remain on the current software build or receive a minor update to the final release version. Selecting `details` from `Software Update` then `Restore Defaults` removes the Mac from the beta program. I restart the machine. Now going back to `Software Update` to see if a new version is available returns an update around the size of 2.5GB. It was around this time that I noticed major sluggishness in the entire system and checking any apps would simply hesitate, not open or freeze entirely. Rebooting did not fix the issue. Much later on in the day after searching various Mac forums I discovered that during Appleâ€™s Big Sur rollout that there were multiple server issues affecting many Mac OS versions and also affecting `Gatekeeper` security. `Gatekeeper` had issues contacting security servers for app verification, which slowed application launching and general system stability. Once Apple addressed their various server issues, MacOS system updating could continue.


## Last Fix

After installing the supplemental BigSur update, the new version was changed to macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 (20B29) which was the most current, non beta build. When checking the software update again though there seemed to somehow be an issue with the Mac still pulling in beta updates even though the machine had been removed from the beta program. I had do look online and do more troubleshooting to figure out how to resolve this. I found an online [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTjUcQp2cM0) referencing the problem with an alternative way to fix it. The solution was to use seed util commands in terminal and not the standard option of system preferences. 

The first step was the re-enroll the machine back into the beta program, while checking the software update status. 

`sudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Seeding.framework/Versions/A/Resources/seedutil enroll DeveloperSeed`

With the update status now showing beta participation, the second step is to remove the beta enrollment for the final time.

`sudo /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Seeding.framework/Versions/A/Resources/seedutil unenroll`

Now the Mac is showing as up to date, macOS Big Sur version 11.0.1, and the machine is not enrolled in any beta program!
