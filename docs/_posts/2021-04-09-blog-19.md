## QEMU/UTM

[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) is an open source machine emulator and virtualization application available for Linux, iOS, macOS and Windows. The function for the [UTM](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/releases) application in this scenario is essentially a wrapper to provide a GUI, making installing a virtual machine quicker. This virtual machine option for M1 Macs is one of the few available at the present time other than using the [technical preview](https://www.parallels.com/blogs/parallels-desktop-apple-silicon-mac/) of Parallels Desktop for Mac. A Windows 10 installation is straightforward starting from the point of having the Windows 10 `.vhdx` file downloaded in addition to the `UTM.dmg` file.

## Configuration/Install

With the `UTM.dmg` downloaded click on the file then drag the program to the applications folder


Open application and select Create a New Virtual Machine


At information tab enter desired virtual machine name, select Operating System at Style dropdown
