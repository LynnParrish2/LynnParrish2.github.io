## QEMU/UTM

[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) is an open source machine emulator and virtualization application available for Linux, iOS, macOS and Windows. The function for the [UTM](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/releases) application in this scenario is essentially a wrapper to provide a GUI, making installing a virtual machine quicker. This virtual machine option for M1 Macs is one of the few available at the present time other than using the [technical preview](https://www.parallels.com/blogs/parallels-desktop-apple-silicon-mac/) of Parallels Desktop for Mac. A Windows 10 installation is straightforward starting from the point of having the Windows 10 `.vhdx` file downloaded in addition to the UTM.dmg file.

## Configuration/Install

With the `UTM.dmg` downloaded click on the file then drag the program to the applications folder


Open application and select Create a New Virtual Machine


At information tab enter desired virtual machine name, select Operating System at Style dropdown


At System Tab select ARM64 for Architecture and set desired memory amount 


In the Drives Tab, click import drive and select the image or `.vhdx` file, set interface to NVMe then save


Press the play button/arrow for the machine in the left pane to start the install process for Windows 10
