## HandBrake

[Handbrake](https://handbrake.fr/) is one of the most useful applications for video conversion and compression. The program is free, open source and available on Linux, Windows and macOS. There is also a universal binary (1.4.0) available in [beta](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake/releases/tag/1.4.0-beta.1) form that supports M1 Macs. Handbrake is very good for converting from `M4V`, `MOV`, `MPEG`,`AVI` and especially `.MOV` video on a Mac to something a lot more convenient, smaller and manageable such as `.MP4` video. Target video formats like `MKV` and `WebM` can also be selected. The conversion speed is greatly improved on the ARM Macs. In addition to the standard GUI version there is also the CLI version in 64-bit for the previously mentioned operating systems/platforms.


## Starting HandBrake

It's easy to get going with the application once installed on a Mac from the `.dmg` file. Launch the program and select `OPEN SOURCE` for the original video file. The Title can be left as default or changed. The Preset encoding setting I like the most is `Very Fast 1080p30` which gives very fast transcoding, a smaller file size but decent video quality. The target destination folder is set in the `Save As:` dropdown. Lastly, press the green start arrow and wait to be alerted upon completion of the new encoded video.
