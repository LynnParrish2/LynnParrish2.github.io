## AWS Infrastructure

## Stage 0

The first part of this lab will be creating an EC2 instance with Ubuntu

The additional item for the assignment will be to make an S3 bucket

## Stage 1 

Install Apache

With the S3 bucket created and the Ubuntu instance already running

use `$ ssh -i cit4.pem ubuntu@65.213.192.25` to enter instance

install apache `sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y apache 2`

start apache 2

## Stage 2

Update index.html file 

cd into /var/www/html

use `sudo vi index.html`

once inside the html file edit the first displayed text 

add name and the ec2 ip address then save and quit

## Stage 3

Create an IAM Role & Policy to Allow S3 access

In AWS go to IAM to create a new role

select EC2 use case and then on to permissions

search for S3 and select full access

skip tags then on to review, give a role name, create role

## Stage 4

Attach the IAM Role to EC2 Instance

Go back to running EC2 instance

Select the actions pane security/modify IAM role

Choose the new S3 role created and save

The new IAM role is now attached to the instance

## Stage 5

Install AWS CLI

In the runnning instance command line perform `sudo apt install -y awscli`

Check the awscli version

## Stage 6

Use AWS CLI with S3

List available S3 buckets `aws s3 ls`

Use the AWS CLI to copy the index.html to S3 bucket

 `aws s3 cp /var/www/html/index.html s3://cit4/index.html`

Transfer is now complete!
